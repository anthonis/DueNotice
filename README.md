### A tool for physicians to transform the smallest twitch of a muscle into a life-saving prediction

This project is a web app designed for physicians to predict preterm births from surface electromyograms. These are voltage-time signals from sensors acquired from [Physionet](https://physionet.org/content/tpehgdb/1.0.1/#files-panel). The app is deployed to [Heroku](https://due-notice.herokuapp.com) and a detailed explanation of its development can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fgA2Q91FUN7XBpi5GyeskhDmsLsUVUu5MUk6FA19TBE/edit#slide=id.p)
