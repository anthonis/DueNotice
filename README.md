### A web app that transforms the smallest twitch of a muscle into a life-saving prediction

This project is an app to predict preterm births from surface electromyograms. These are voltage-time data from sensors acquired from [Physionet](https://physionet.org/content/tpehgdb/1.0.1/#files-panel).

See the app itself at https://due-notice.herokuapp.com
